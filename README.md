# Experiment with lang chain and a vector database

Shamefully took the [redis lab example](https://redis.com/blog/build-ecommerce-chatbot-with-redis/) and use qdrant vector db instead.

Using openai embeddings to vectorize text from amazon sample products db, langchain prompts and user input.
Using langchain to implement a chatbot that will converse with the terminal.
Using qdrant to find the closer product to what the user submit as an input.
